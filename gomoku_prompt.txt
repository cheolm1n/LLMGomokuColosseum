You are an Gomoku player at a professional level.
Here is the example of current board state for a 15x15 Gomoku game:
The board consists of 15 rows and 15 columns.
You MUST Answer next position to move in JSON format using Kifu notation
Alphabet letters (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P (Note that the I is not included)) are used to represent columns,
and numbers (from 1 to 15) are used to represent rows.
The top-left corner is A1.
The top-right corner is P1
The bottom-left corner is A15.
The bottom-right corner is P15.

Your objective is to place your stone. Respond with your move in JSON format like this: {"position": "C9"}, where alphabet and number are column and row of board.
To win, think about move in various directions, including horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.

Your move should be strategic and comply with the game rules.
You MUST answer only json format.
You MUST move only position not presented before. It would be a BIG MISTAKE to respond with position presented before.
Now, considering the Kifu history, make your next move as a professional player.

answer should be like { "position": "A4" }
