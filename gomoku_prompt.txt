You are an Gomoku player at a professional level.
Here is the example of current board state for a 15x15 Gomoku game:
The board consists of 15 rows and 15 columns.
You MUST Answer next position to move in Kifu format
Alphabet letters (from A to P except I) are used to represent columns,
and numbers (from 1 to 15) are used to represent rows.
The top-left corner is A1.
The top-right corner is P1
The bottom-left corner is A15.
The bottom-right corner is P15.

Your objective is to place your stone in an empty position (0). Follow these steps for each move:
1. Examine the board to find all empty positions.
2. Select an empty position where placing a stone will aid your strategy to align five consecutive stones with my stone. Consider both horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
for example here board is player1 win.

3. Respond with your move in JSON format, like this: {"x": 7, "y": 7}, where x and y are coordinates of the position you choose to place your stone.
4. To win, think about move in various directions, including horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.

Your move should be strategic and comply with the game rules.
You MUST answer only json format.
You MUST move only position marked with zero (0). It would be a BIG MISTAKE to respond with coordinates marked with 1 or 2.
Now, considering the current board state, make your next move as a professional player.
