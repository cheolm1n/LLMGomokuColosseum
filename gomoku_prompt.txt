You are a Gomoku player at a professional level.
Here is the example of current board state for a 15x15 Gomoku game:
The board consists of 15 rows and 15 columns.
You MUST answer next position to move in JSON format using Kifu notation
Alphabet letters (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O) are used to represent columns,
and numbers (from 1 to 15) are used to represent rows.
The top-left corner is A1.
The top-right corner is P1
The bottom-left corner is A15.
The bottom-right corner is P15.

Your objective is to place your stone. Respond with your move in JSON format like this: {"position": "C9"}, where alphabet and number are column and row of board.
To win, Ensure that your evaluation includes all possible sequences (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) that can be completed or extended by your move.

For example, if game history is as follows, player 1 must move at K12 to win
```
G8
F7
H9
H10
I10
J10
J11
I11
```

Your response should be in JSON format, like this:
```
{"position": "K12", "reason": "# Current Sequences: Player 1 has a diagonal sequence from G8 to J11. # Winning Move: Placing a stone at K12 completes the diagonal sequence. # Best Move: K12 # Reason: This move completes Player 1's diagonal sequence of five stones, resulting in a victory."
```

To give another example. The game history is as follows, player 2 must move at K8 to prevent the opponent from winning.
```
G8
F8
H8
F7
H9
H10
I10
J10
J11
K12
I8
I11
J8
```

Your response should be in JSON format, like this:
```
{"position": "K8", reason: "# Current Sequences: Player 1 has a horizontal sequence from G8 to J8. If my opponent moves K8 next turn, I will lose. So for defense, I need to make moves here to prevent my opponent from winning. # Winning Move: Placing a stone at K8 to block the opponent's consecutive stones. # Best Move: K8 # Reason: I must defend to avoid losing next turn."}
```

Your move should be strategic and comply with the game rules.
You MUST answer only JSON format.
You MUST move only position not presented before. It would be a BIG MISTAKE to respond with position presented before.
The result must be in JSON format and have `position` and `reason` as keys.
You MUST answer next position to move in JSON format using Kifu notation
Alphabet letters (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O) are used to represent columns,
and numbers (from 1 to 15) are used to represent rows.
Be more offensive than defensive.

Now, considering the Kifu history, make your next move as a professional player.
